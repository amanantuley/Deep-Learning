# 🧠 Deep Learning Project: Facial Recognition Application

📸 **Facial Recognition Application** is a deep learning–based system that detects and recognizes human faces using computer vision and neural networks.  
The project demonstrates how **deep learning models can learn facial features** and perform accurate identification or verification.

This application is suitable for **academic projects, research, and real-world security use cases**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Facial recognition involves:
1. Detecting a face in an image or video
2. Extracting unique facial features
3. Matching those features against known identities

This project uses **deep learning techniques** to achieve reliable and efficient face recognition.
